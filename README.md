# **ARKTIK Global Initiative Director Alleges Fraudulent Vehicle Sales, Demands Justice**  

**[Houston, Texas] – February 24, 2025** – J. Michael Morris, Executive Director of **ARKTIK Global Initiative**, a Texas-based nonprofit, is bringing to light what he claims to be **fraudulent and deceptive vehicle sales practices** by **AutoNation USA Houston**, in connection with the purchase of two vehicles in **September 2024**. Morris, who is disabled, intended to use these vehicles for **ARKTIK Global Initiative's** operations and community service efforts (**www.arktikinitiative.com**).  

## **Details of the Alleged Fraud**

Morris alleges that **AutoNation USA Houston** sold him a defective **2019 BMW X3** and a **2019 Mercedes-Benz GLC 300** under false pretenses. The alleged violations include:

- **Misrepresentation of Price:** The **BMW X3 was initially listed at $19,000** but was later quoted at **a higher price**.
- **Undisclosed Defects:** The **BMW X3** suffered from **serious mechanical issues**, including **a coolant leak and dashboard malfunctions**. **Valerie Bittle, AutoNation Sales Manager, allegedly admitted in a recorded call that a required pre-sale repair order was never completed.**
- **Issues with the Mercedes-Benz GLC 300:** The vehicle **had a slow leak in the rear wheel** and **an abnormal braking or deceleration issue** that was not disclosed at the time of sale.
- **Warranty & Service Failures:** Despite initial assurances, **AutoNation allegedly stopped responding to requests for repairs**.
- **Loan Reversal Obstacles:** **American Credit Acceptance (ACA)** initially acknowledged that **a loan reversal was possible**, but instead, **repossession occurred on January 9, 2025**, and both vehicles were sold at **auction**, **compounding financial damages**.

## **Key Evidence Supporting the Allegations**

Morris is providing **documented evidence** to back his claims, including:

- **Recorded Call:** A call with **AutoNation Sales Manager Valerie Bittle**, confirming the **BMW X3’s required pre-sale repair order was never completed**.
- **ACA Call Transcript:** A conversation where **ACA representatives initially indicated that a loan reversal was possible**.
- **Discussion with Rashad Pride:** A transcript and **recording of the conversation with Rashad Pride**, addressing the **vehicle defects and warranty repair issues**.
- **.MOV Video Evidence:** Footage taken **days before repossession**, proving that the vehicles **still had paper tags expiring September 22, 2024**, well beyond the normal issuance period.
- **TxDMV Complaint:** Documentation of a **formal complaint filed with the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles on November 12, 2024**.

## **ARKTIK Global Initiative's Involvement**
