[BEGIN CALL TRANSCRIPT - September 5, 2024]

AutoNation Representative: Hi, how are you doing today, sir?

J. Michael Morris: I'm sorry, your name again?

AutoNation Representative: Rashad Pride.

J. Michael Morris: Okay. Hi, Mr. Rashad.

AutoNation Representative: Hey sir. I received an email from you yesterday talking, concerned about two cars that were purchased through us.

J. Michael Morris: Yes, sir.

AutoNation Representative: So I'm gonna reach out to you and um talk to you about them. So, uh, what's going on, sir? How can I help?

J. Michael Morris: Okay. Um there's two vehicles. There is the BMW and there's the Mercedes.

AutoNation Representative: Yes, sir.

J. Michael Morris: Okay.

AutoNation Representative: I I see the Mercedes um and I was speaking to my sales manager, she said that I um somebody else you were with purchased uh BMW. And that's the one having the major issue? Or is it is it the Mercedes having issues?

J. Michael Morris: I purchased both vehicles. The I can tell you what happened. So I went to BMW North, looked at the BMW. Um, I had actually my wife and I sat down inside of the showroom, uh, and asked about seeing vehicles for $20,000 cash or less, because I had $20,000 cash, which is exactly how much I spent with you guys. So, I asked them for a $20,000 car. He went and grabbed the paperwork for the X for the uh X3. Uh it said $19,000. He, you know, we talked for a little bit. He got up and he left out. And then he came back and said something about his sales manager and that the BMW now is like, he wanted to show me the BMW and take a test drive. We did that. He said the BMW was then $23,000. I refused. I left because it was a price upping. That same day Jose gave me a call. I came out to you guys to see the Mercedes. I saw the Mercedes and we test drove the Mercedes and my wife said that she wanted it. Uh Jose told me about the BMW and said that y'all were sister dealerships with the other one. And so I was like, alright cool. Uh, and he said that he could make it happen. He could get the BMW over there and I could buy both of those from you guys and instead of me spending the 20 grand for one, um, we would get two vehicles for 20 grand and that was the agreement. 20 grand each vehicle. Uh, when I went ahead and got the cashier's check taken care of. We took care of one vehicle. I came back to get the other vehicle. Nothing was said to me whatsoever about there being a problem with the car. As a matter of fact, a week after purchase, both cars, sir, or a problem with the BMW?

J. Michael Morris: There's been problems with both cars, but the the major issues with the BMW. So, I called y'all. No, I reached out to Jose and to Muhammad uh less than a week later about the dash issue because there were times that the display cluster was not showing at all and that it was times that it was showing but it would be moved over to the right or to the left, I don't know how many inches, so you couldn't see the speed. Uh, I had to turn the vehicle off, turn it on. Turn the vehicle off for 30 minutes. Turn it back on and then it started working. However, less than a month later, I reached out to you guys. No, a month later, I reached out to you guys because when I was driving, all of a sudden my car showed an alert for low coolant with a lot of things saying um well, with the statement stating that driving the vehicle could cause damage. So I came home, parked the vehicle because my what I do is, I I do mobile details to to supplement and to provide revenue for my nonprofit organization. So, when when I couldn't move the car, I gave Jose a call. I reached out to you guys and then I spoke to Valerie Bittle. Valerie informed me that the vehicle was um, she said it's unfortunate, but when I purchased the vehicle, the she looked through the thing and the, what she, what her words were on a recorded call, was that the uh the p the repair order, which is normally done, wasn't done on my vehicle and it was supposed to be done at the sister dealership, who actually did the uh inspection or was supposed to do the inspection, whatever it was. about the BMW start, not about the Mercedes.

J. Michael Morris: We're talking about the BMW X3, yes.

AutoNation Representative: Okay. And is is the BMW in your name as well? Or is it someone else's name?

J. Michael Morris: The BMW is in my wife's name.

AutoNation Representative: Okay. Can I I can I pull up um Her name is Teneille. T E T E N N I L L E. It's her first name. T as in Tango, E as in Echo. Her last name is the same as mine.

AutoNation Representative: Okay. Sorry about that.

J. Michael Morris: So with the BMW, when um with the alert, it said to park the car. I parked the car. There was still smells of uh scents of coolant coming through the AC system. Um, I filled up the coolant that night and then the next morning I was going to bring it to you guys, drove the car and I started the car, no issues. I went to the store, came home but before I could make it all the way home, the alert came on again. That's when I reached out is because this is now less than 24 hours. I've already put coolant in and I had to go and buy more coolant for a car that was less than a month and a half old. I reached out to you guys, I was told by Valerie that, you know, the inspection was supposed to be done by BMW North, they didn't do the repair order, and I asked her at that time for a a refund. I later came back because the 24 hours later, I was like, I mean, I over the weekend, because she asked me to reach out to BMW North. I reached out to them. Their sales manager told me to reach back out to y'all because she was completely wrong with the fact that since the sale took place at uh USA, that I had to address it with y'all and not with BMW North because that's where she told me to go. That is correct. When when I reached back out, uh, she hasn't answered any emails. So I actually out of the spirit of trying to work together because Jose was really cordial. I enjoyed the process and I just hope that it was just a matter of miscommunication and something else went wrong. Because the sale part was was kind of smooth. Me and Jose, that it was a pleasant experience for my wife and I. And maybe he didn't know about the the problems. I don't know. I'm not gonna pretend to know what happened behind the scenes. I know that I purchased a vehicle that did not have a repair order done, but I was not made aware of any problems with the vehicle at BMW North nor at at USA that the car even had a problem. The first time that I knew of anything about it was Miss Bittle letting me know. Now, I don't know if she knew that I didn't know or if she knew that this would create as much of an issue as it did, but by not responding, I sent out an email hoping to partner with you guys to try to find a resolution where we would probably keep the cars and then have the repairs done if you guys would take care of the repairs and stuff, we would have worked with you guys. However, lack of communication, stonewalling us, it just feels like and then when I reached back out to to to be told that, you know, y'all don't talk to individuals. That that actually did happen on the last recorded call was someone to tell me that y'all don't talk to us anymore, uh, that we had to reach out, I was told that I have to reach out to uh your corporate office and that's exactly what I did. Between them, the Better Business Bureau and I reached out to Ken Paxton's office, which I was going to submit everything over to them today, but instead, with the finance office telling me, finance company um that there were ways to just go ahead and try to reverse it, there was there was no need for me to to continue.

AutoNation Representative: And have you had the vehicles looked at at all? So no one has inspected your vehicle or anything at all?

J. Michael Morris: No one has done a thing. No one has come out to look. No one has called me to to have anything done. What she said to me at the end of that call, which was still a recorded call, the only communication I've had was Miss Bittle over phone. She said I was trying to help you out. Now you have to just reach out to BMW North.

AutoNation Representative: Well sir, I apologize for going through all these issues like that. That's not that definitely wasn't our intent. Um sell you a vehicle that had that has issues. Um, I don't know why and I I definitely speak speak to to Valerie shortly why they were told that the vehicle had not been through the shop, she said or the repair wasn't done on the vehicle. I don't know where she got that information from because for us we don't as a company we don't sell vehicles that have not been through the shop like that. Um do you Mr. Morris, obviously because you're managing with the vehicle, with the BMW, you're saying that the car is not drivable, correct?

J. Michael Morris: Correct. It it constantly has the coolant issue. She stated that there was a coolant issue. So if there was ever an issue with coolant for this vehicle, it's still the same problem.

AutoNation Representative: Um let's do this. Let me set up because I can see that you do have a service contract. The vehicle is AutoNation certified for one, so that would fix repairs on it and then I see you also have extended um warranty as well, um with Easy Care.

J. Michael Morris: Yeah, but here's the thing. Without telling me what was wrong with my car, I have no faith, especially when no one reached out and all we've received was stonewalls. The only reason why I did not submit actually two of the press releases are out there. The only reason why I did not submit it to national press because that that's what was supposed to happen this evening is because I was waiting.

AutoNation Representative: And I can't speak to to issues as far as um press release or anything like that. Um, what I'm trying to do, I'm trying to. The email that you sent to me was asking um for help to resolve the matter and Right right, because that's what I I wanted to do was resolve it. I wanted to speak with you and then find a resolution.

AutoNation Representative: Yes sir. So that's why I'm reaching out to you now to find to to We can we can meet. We can we can meet at your office. But I need to know what like I'll I'll come to meet with you.

AutoNation Representative: I just like and for me is um by all means you can my thing is I'm trying to get your vehicle fixed.

J. Michael Morris: Okay. So what is it that that you're offering to do?

AutoNation Representative: I'm going to get your vehicle you. You said this car, and I said, I'm just sitting and still talking to you, this came from our BMW North location.

J. Michael Morris: Correct, where I was told that the BMW was $19,000. I spoke to Jose who also who confirmed the vehicle for $19,000 when we were sitting at his desk. I took pictures of it with my phone. So, it there's an inconsistency. The only reason why we kept the vehicles even after going to Frost Bank because the first cashier's check came from Frost. The second payment of $10,000 came directly from my debit account from Frost. My banker at Frost were was the person we had been talking to about financing. I did what we did because I kept my word with Jose. I felt like, yo, this we're doing business together. I enjoyed the communication. I felt that there was possible synergy with with AutoNation as far as you know, trying to see if we could get more vehicles later on for our nonprofit through you guys, because I believe in taking care of businesses that are local rather than businesses that I don't know who the stakeholders are and if they are concerned with the community that they sell in. That's what Arctic Global does.

AutoNation Representative: Yes sir. Um, And is the and the vehicles obviously at your house right now, sir? Yes, it is. It's at my house. It's in the uh it's in the driveway, sir. And the address is the 4326 Street Hill, you know?

J. Michael Morris: Yes sir.

AutoNation Representative: Okay. Um, what I can do is I'm going to um get a tow truck to go grab the vehicle. Okay. And I'm gonna get it taken over to the BMW North facility. Really? To their um to their service shop. Okay. And have that way they can I I really don't trust them, sir. They're the people that that told me that the vehicle originally was $19,000. I have pictures of that, the paper. I even brought it with me. And then magically the BMW is now $23,000. That that I found that really messed up that day. I didn't have a problem with it because I planned on paying it off cash pretty quickly. But I'm I'm I don't think that I even want the car. What else is wrong with it? I don't know what else is wrong with it and no one is tel no one told me anything. No one said, hey, look, the reason why it's the only reason why I'm frustrated about that is because I drove that car seven hours to Oklahoma and seven hours back to get my son. I have ALS. That's an issue.

AutoNation Representative: I'm sorry. He said you drove it to Oklahoma and drove it back and that's the issue?

J. Michael Morris: Yeah, I I drove it to Oklahoma and back here in uh at the end of July, start of August to to get my son I drove it to Oklahoma, picked up my son and drove back. I have I have I've been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. I don't know if you know what ALS is. But not having access to medical staff, you know, the only reason why it's an issue is driving a car that's unreliable that I assumed was a reliable car. I assumed it was a 2019 BMW with no issues because of the Carfax that I was given by Jose. So I was under the impression that there was no to be doing a Carfax wouldn't return any issues on the vehicle. Okay. And there's there's even like from the standpoint of like um it is not it's it's definitely not an excuse or anything like that. It said um we got the vehicle from the BMW location, um and we sold the vehicle to you. Correct. You know what I'm saying? So now um I'm trying to rectify that issue and get your vehicle and then see that get in look at see exactly what's wrong with the vehicle? But the problem with that is that they they delivered you a vehicle that was sold to me that had the problem and was not repaired. That's that's the issue.

AutoNation Representative: And and that's my thing. I I don't know if the two things are related like I said, I don't have access to their system to see like um I said if if the vehicle is able to drive from here to Oklahoma and back, then I I don't think it at the time it had major issues, because obviously it answer a lot of miles and the car wouldn't have got stranded on the side of the road type of thing. So that's why I um for us here, I don't have any BMW master mechanics. Okay. But with them obviously they have master mechanics and um I would I would rather go to a different BMW dealership for for for work than to them. I don't trust them. They've already been twice, two issues, a the price problem. Secondly, the fact that it was brought to the other location with issues still wrong with it. I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm so not okay with trusting them with the safety of me and my family who ride in that vehicle.

AutoNation Representative: Yes sir. So we do have another BMW location in the Woodlands. Okay. I'll take it there. that's better option for you. Okay, to do it that way. Yep. So, I see that you um you do have the Easy Care warranty. So with the Easy Care warranty you has free towing.

J. Michael Morris: So you're talking about me utilizing things that that that would constitute the the the uh the the the finance company stating that things have been utilized thus not being able to reverse the the contract. I understand what what and that's you just operating in your dealership's best interest, but it's not in my best interest.

AutoNation Representative: No sir I wasn't I just saw that it's it's a free towing service. That's why I was saying get to to free I that's I was looking that. I wasn't looking that as a a trick or anything like that like you said. I'm just trying to help. I know you've had some bad experiences, but I haven't spoken to you or anything. I'm trying to fix the issue for you sir. That's all I was trying to do. It was a trick behind you. Um if you're uncomfortable using the warranty then I'll pay for it travel on my own pockets.

J. Michael Morris: Here's here's the thing. I wouldn't want you to pay for something out of your pocket if it's not you if it wasn't really your thing. If it wasn't for you to do wrong. And as as as a founder of a corporation and as as as someone who manages and works and operates, I I wouldn't want you to fall on your sword for that. That that that's not helpful to me or to you, or to your company. You know what I mean?

AutoNation Representative: But but you don't want to use the free one so No, what I said is I don't want to use the thing that's attached to to financing. I don't want to to put myself in a position where I I'm obligated to do something else. But I will but here's the thing, I'm willing to pay for towing. I'm willing to personally pay for towing.

AutoNation Representative: Okay. I just want I just want to clear one thing up for you, sir. So the finance company and the warranty company are two separate things completely. So like the warranty is is is fully cancellable at a set at a separate transaction. The finance company doesn't sell the warranty or anything like that. So it's like there's two separate there's two separate things. So um that's why I was saying like if if it's it's if it's free to you.

J. Michael Morris: Okay. Then if it's that case, then yeah, I'm willing to do that. You know, because I'm I'm not looking to try and take something from you or from anybody that I that's not already due me.

AutoNation Representative: Thank you for that. Yes sir. And and that's I think that's the first step is getting the vehicle looked at at a um at a BMW facility. So you can exactly see what the issue is wrong from the vehicle. Um and and go from there. And you can make a decision about that. All right cool. I'm with that.
One second. Okay. the phone number really quick. Do you have a 10, sir? Do you want me to email the information? No.

J. Michael Morris: I still would like for you to email it over to me, but uh no, I don't have a pen but I have my Macbook.

AutoNation Representative: Okay. Um the number for the Roadside Distance. Okay. is 1 8 6 6 Okay hold on. I'm sorry. 1866. I I got I I'm lost at 1866. Okay, then it's 36 05 8 3 1.

J. Michael Morris: Yes, sir. I have 866-360-5831.

AutoNation Representative: Yes sir. Yes sir. Okay. And what do I say?

Um, and it was like a we were told, you know, you just have to drive it and it'll it'll, you know, inflate the rest of the way on its own and it should seal back up. But there is really something wrong with the tire. It keeps deflating. And the thing is, it it we can't find a hole. So it's either the tire or the rim. And if the rim itself was bent, then, you know, a bent rim leaks air. Uh We don't know.

AutoNation Representative: And you said you couldn't find the hole put any water already?

J. Michael Morris: No, sir. No, we didn't. We didn't put it under water. We didn't take the tire off of the off of the vehicle. We haven't taken the tire off. We've looked for it. I I can I can lift the car and rotate the wheel because I do details.

But it's supposed to be stay at 37 or 38. and this is in the summertime where temperatures are above 90, you know? So it's not because it's cooling at night because the temperatures aren't aren't dropping below 85. So it's not that issue. And it just slowly turns right there. Let me see. Okay.

**Legal Analysis & Implications**

1.  **Deceptive Sales Practices:** The initial bait and switch tactic at BMW North constitutes deceptive sales practices.
2.  **Undisclosed Vehicle Issues:** Failure to disclose known coolant and dashboard issues with the BMW X3 before the sale constitutes misrepresentation.
3.  **Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability:** The ongoing coolant issue renders the vehicle unfit for its intended purpose, potentially breaching the implied warranty of merchantability.
4.  **Inadequate Resolution Efforts:** The conflicting information and lack of effective follow-up from AutoNation representatives demonstrates a failure to adequately address the customer's concerns.
5.  **Potential Violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA):** The combination of deceptive sales tactics and failure to disclose vehicle defects may constitute violations of the DTPA.


6.  **Conclusion**

This document provides clear evidence of deceptive business practices, financial misrepresentation, and the inadequate handling of significant vehicle issues by AutoNation. The full transcript is made public to ensure transparency, legal accountability, and consumer protection.
