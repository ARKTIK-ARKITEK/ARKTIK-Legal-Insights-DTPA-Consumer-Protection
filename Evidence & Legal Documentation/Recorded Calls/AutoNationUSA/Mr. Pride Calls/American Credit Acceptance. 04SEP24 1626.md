# ACA Call Transcript (September 6, 2024)

## Introduction & Purpose
This document serves as a full disclosure of an unedited call transcript between **J. Michael Morris** and **American Credit Acceptance (ACA)** on **September 6, 2024**. The purpose of releasing this transcript is to document **deceptive financial practices, misrepresentation, and wrongful repossession** that led to significant financial harm.

### Key Points Confirmed:
- **ACA acknowledged issues** with AutoNation’s sales practices and agreed to file a complaint.
- **ACA stated that a loan reversal was possible**, meaning the financial burden should never have remained.
- **ACA representatives advised non-payment** while investigating the refund, contradicting their later justification for repossession.
- **Despite these acknowledgments, ACA repossessed and sold the vehicles at auction on January 9, 2025**, further compounding the damages.

Given ACA’s misrepresentations and the financial harm suffered, this document is part of a **legal repository** to ensure **accountability, transparency, and restitution**.

**Leanna (ACA Representative):**
> Thank you for calling American Credit Acceptance. My name is Leanna. Can I have your first and last name, please?

**J. Michael Morris:**
> Yes, um, my name is J. Michael Morris.

**Leanna:**
> Thank you so very much for verifying your information in our phone system...

[Verification of contact number and email]

**Leanna:**
> Today you're calling in reference to your 2019 Mercedes-Benz?

**J. Michael Morris:**
> No, the Mercedes is my wife’s. Mine is the BMW X3. We purchased two vehicles at the same time. I paid **$20,000 in cash—$10,000 down on each vehicle**...

**Leanna:**
> Okay, so you're saying that the dealership messed up a lot of things?

**J. Michael Morris:**
> Yes, and they sold me a defective vehicle. **Valerie Bittle, the AutoNation sales manager, confirmed in a recorded call that BMW North Houston never completed the repair order before selling it to me...**

**Leanna:**
> Wow. That’s a lot. That’s crazy. So what I’m going to do for you, I’m going to talk to a member of management and see what the best route to do is, since you guys are suing. Give me one moment, okay?

[Hold music]

**Leanna:**
> Thank you for patiently holding. We’re sending out a **complaint against that dealership**. I’m also looking over your contract right now. A member of management will send out a complaint on your behalf as well.

**J. Michael Morris:**
> I appreciate that, but we need to talk about how we get this resolved. ACA is financing the vehicles. If the sale was fraudulent, what do we need to do to get this corrected?

**Leanna:**
> If a customer doesn’t want a vehicle anymore and it’s early in the loan as it is for you, the contract will **reverse**. So you wouldn’t owe us anything, and the dealership would have to refund your down payment.

**J. Michael Morris:**
> That’s what I needed to hear. So, if this is reversed, we won’t have to sue. We don’t want a fight. We just want to be treated fairly.

**Leanna:**
> Understandable. That makes sense. Respect for that. I’m going to double-check on the refund process...

[Hold music]

**Leanna:**
> Thank you for holding. We have all the facts straight. **You haven’t made any payments yet, so there’s a possibility the loan can be reversed**. You need to call back tomorrow between **8 AM and 5 PM** to talk to the **Dealer Relations Department** about reversing it.

**J. Michael Morris:**
> Okay, so if you reverse the loan, we don’t owe ACA anything, and the dealership has to refund us?

**Leanna:**
> Correct. If the contract is reversed, the dealership will owe you your money back.

**J. Michael Morris:**
> Got it. I’ll call back tomorrow. Appreciate your help.

**Leanna:**
> No problem. I hope this is resolved soon.
