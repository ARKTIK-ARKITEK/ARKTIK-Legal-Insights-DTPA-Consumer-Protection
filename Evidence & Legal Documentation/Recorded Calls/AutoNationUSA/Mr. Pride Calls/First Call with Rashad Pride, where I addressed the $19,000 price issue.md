Conversation Script & Transcript:

(Beginning of call)

J. Morris: I'm sorry, your name again?

Rashad Pride: Rashad Pride.

J. Morris: Okay. Hi, Mr. Rashad.

Rashad Pride: Hey, sir. I received the email from you yesterday. I was concerned about two cars that were purchased through us?

J. Morris: Yes sir.

Rashad Pride: So, I want to reach out to you, and to talk to you about it. So, what's going on, sir? How can I help?

J. Morris: Okay. Um, there's two vehicles. There's the BMW and there's the Mercedes.

Rashad Pride: Yes, sir.

J. Morris: Okay. I see the Mercedes and I was speaking to my sales manager, she said that somebody else who was with you purchased the BMW and that is the one having the major issue. So, it's just the Mercedes having issues.

J. Morris: I purchased both vehicles. The- I can tell you what happened. So, I went to BMW North, looked at the BMW. I had actually, my wife and I sat down inside of the showroom and asked about seeing vehicles for twenty-thousand-dollars cash or less because I had twenty thousand cash, which is exactly how much I spent with you guys. So I asked them for a twenty-thousand-dollar car. He went and grabbed the paperwork for the X- for the X-3. It said 19,000. He, you know, we talked for a little bit. He got up and he left out and then he came back and said something about his sales manager and that the BMW now is like, he wanted to show me the BMW and take a test drive. We did that. He said the BMW was then twenty-three-thousand. I refused.

I left because it was a price up-ing. That same day, Jose gave me a call. I came out to you guys to see the Mercedes. I saw the Mercedes and we test-drove the Mercedes. And my wife said she wanted it. Jose told me about the BMW and said that you are sister dealerships with the other one. And so I was like, “all right, cool.”

And he said that he could make it happen. He could get the BMW over there and I could buy both of those from you guys. And instead of me spending the twenty-grand for one, um, we would get two vehicles for 20-grand and that was the agreement, 20-grand each vehicle. Uh, when I went ahead and got the cashier's check taken care of, we took care of one vehicle. I came back to get the other vehicle. Nothing was said to me whatsoever about there being a problem with the car. As a matter of fact, a week after purchase, well we-

Rashad Pride: So, there's both cars, sir, or a problem with the BMW?

J. Morris: There's been problems with both cars, but the the major issues with the BMW. So, I called ya'll, no, I reached out to Jose and to Mohammad, uh, less than a week later about the dash issue because there were times that the display cluster was not showing at all. And that it was times that it would show, but it would be moved over to the right or to the left, I don't know how many inches, so you couldn't see the speed. Uh, I had to turn the vehicle off, turn it on, turn the vehicle off for 30-minutes, turn it back on and then it started working. However, less than a month later, I reached out to you guys. No, a month later I reached out to you guys because when I was driving, all of a sudden my car showed an alert for low coolant, with a lot of things saying- well, with the statement stating that driving the vehicle could cause damage. So, I came home, parked the vehicle because my what I do is, I, I do mobile details to, to supplement and to provide revenue for my non-profit organization. So, when I couldn't move the car I gave Jose a call. I reached out to you guys, and then I spoke to Valerie Biddle. Valerie informed me that the vehicle was- she said it's unfortunate, but when I purchased the vehicle, she looked through the thing, and the what she- what her words were on a recorded call, was that the the repair order which is normally done wasn't done on my vehicle, and it was supposed to be done at the sister dealership, who actually did the inspection or was supposed to do the inspection. Whatever it was.

Rashad Pride: You're talking about the BMW, Sir, and not the Mercedes?

J. Morris: We're talking about the BMW, X-3, yes.

Rashad Pride: Okay. and and Sorry to cut you off, but is the BMW in your name as well or someone else's name?

J. Morris: The BMW is in my wife's name.

Rashad Pride: Okay. Can I so, can I pull up um-

J. Morris: Her name is Tenille. T. E. T. E. N. N. I. L. L. E. It's her first name. T. as in Tango, E. as in Echo. Her last name is the same as mine.

Rashad Pride: Okay. Sorry about that.

(Brief Pause)

J. Morris: So with the BMW, when- um, with the alert, it said to park the car. I parked the car. There was still smells of scents of coolant, coming through the A. C. system. Um, I filled up the coolant that night and then the next morning I was going to bring it to you guys. Drove the car, and I started the car, no issues. I went to the store, came home, but before I can make it all the way home, the alert came on again. That's when I reached out, is because this is now less than 24-hours. I've already put coolant in and I had to go and buy more coolant for a car that was less than a month-and-a-half old. I reached out to you guys, I was told by Valerie that, you know, the inspection was supposed to be done by BMW north. They didn't do the repair order. And I asked her at that time for a refund. I later came back, because the 24-hours later. I was like, I mean, over the weekend because she asked me to reach out to BMW north. I reached out to them, there's sales manager told me to reach back out to you all because she was completely wrong with the fact that, since the sale took place at USA, that I had to address it with you all and not with BMW north, because that's where she told me to go. So, when-when I reached back out, uh, she hasn't answered any emails. So, I actually, out of the spirit of trying to work together, because Jose was really cordial, I enjoyed the process and I just hope that it was just a matter of miscommunication and something else went wrong. Because the sales part, was was kind of smooth. Me and Jose, there was a pleasant experience for my wife and I. And maybe he didn't know about the problems. I don't know. I'm not going to pretend to know what happened behind the scenes. I know that I purchased a vehicle that did not have a repair order done, but I was not made aware of any problems with the vehicle at BMW north, nor at USA, that the car even had a problem. The first time that I knew anything about it, was Ms. Biddle letting me know. Now, I don't know if she knew that I didn't know or if she knew that this would create as much of an issue as it did, but by not responding. I sent out an email hoping to partner with you guys, to try to find a resolution where we would probably keep the cars and then have the repairs done. If you guys would take care of the repairs and stuff, we would have worked with you guys. However, lack of communication, stonewalling us, it just feels like, and then when I reach back out to, to- to be told that, you know, you all don't talk to individuals. That, that actually did happen on the last recorded call with someone to tell me that you all don't talk to us any more. Uh, that we- I had to reach out- I was told that I have to reach out to, uh, your corporate office, and that's exactly what I did. Between them, the Better Business Bureau, and I reached out to Ken Paxton's office, which I was going to submit everything over to them today, but instead, with the finance office telling me- finance company, um, that there were ways to just go ahead and try to reverse it, there was- there was no need for me to to continue.

Rashad Pride: And have you had the vehicle looked at at all, sir? No one's inspected your vehicle or the vehicles at all?

J. Morris: No one has done a thing. No one has come out to look, no one has called me to to have anything done. What she said to me at the end of that call which was still a recorded call. The only communication I've had was Ms. Biddle over phone. She said, "I was trying to help you out, now you have to just reach out to BMW North."

Rashad Pride: All right. Rashad Pride: Well, sir, I apologize that you're going through all these issues like that. That's not- that definitely wasn't our intent. Um- to sell you a vehicle that had- that has issues. Um, I don't know why and I, I definitely will speak- speak to Ms. Valerie shortly. Why it was told that the vehicle had not been through the shop, she said or the repair order hasn't been done on the vehicle. I don't know where she got that information from, because for us, we don't- as a company we don't sell vehicles that have not been through the shop. Like that, is that's not what we do here. Um-

(Brief Silence)

Rashad Pride: Do you-

(Brief Silence)

Rashad Pride: This being, obviously I can see, the Master being with the vehicle with the BMW, you're saying that the car's not driveable, correct?

J. Morris: Correct. It- it constantly has the coolant issue. She stated that there was a coolant issue. So, if there was ever an issue with coolant, for this vehicle it's still the same problem.

Rashad Pride: Got it. I, um- Rashad Pride: Let's do this. Let me set up, because I can see that you do have a service contract. The vehicle is Automation-Certified, so that will fix repairs on it. And then I see you also have extended warranty as well. Um- with EasyCare.

J. Morris: Yeah, but here's the thing. Without telling me what was wrong with my car, I have no faith. Especially when no one reached out and all we've received was stonewalls. The only reason why I did not submit- actually, two of the press releases are out there. The only reason why I did not submit it to national press, because that- that's what was supposed to happen this evening, is because I was waiting.

Rashad Pride: Yes, sir. Um- and-and I can't speak going to issues as far as, um, press releases and things like that. Um, What, I'm trying to do- I'm trying to- the email that you sent to me, was asking um, for help to resolve the matter.

J. Morris: Right, right. Because that's what I- I wanted to do was resolve it. I wanted to speak with you and then find a resolution.

Rashad Pride: Yes, sir. So, that's why I'm-I'm reaching out to you now to find, to, to-

J. Morris: We can- we can meet- we can- we can meet at your office. But I need to know what- like- I- I'll come to meet with you.

Rashad Pride: Yes, sir. Like- and- for me is um- by all means you can. My thing is I'm trying to get your vehicle fixed.

J. Morris: Okay. So, what is it that that you're offering to do?

Rashad Pride: I'm going to get your vehicle- You said this car- and I said- I'm just listening and still talking to you, the vehicle came from our BMW North location.

J. Morris: Correct, where I was told that the BMW was 19,000. I spoke to Jose, who also who confirmed the vehicle for 19,000 when we're sitting at his desk. I took pictures of it with my phone. So it- there's an inconsistency, and the only reason why we kept the vehicles even after going to Frost Bank because the first cashier's check came from Frost. The second payment of ten-thousand-dollars came directly from my debit account, from Frost. My banker at Frost were- was the person we have been talking to about financing. I did what we did because I kept my word with Jose. I felt like, "Yo, this we're- we're doing business together. I enjoyed the communication. I felt that there was possible synergy with Automation as far as, you know, trying to see if we could get more vehicles later on for our non-profit through you guys, because I believe in taking care of businesses that are local, rather than businesses that I don't know who the stakeholders are. And if they are concerned with the community that they sell in. That's what Arctic Global does.

Rashad Pride: Yes, sir. Um-

(Brief Pause)

Rashad Pride: Is there- is-is the vehicle obviously at your house right now, sir?

J. Morris: Yes, it is. It's at my house. It's in the, uh, it's in the-in the driveway, sir.

Rashad Pride: And the dad address is to 4031 of Sterling Hills?

J. Morris: Yes sir.

Rashad Pride: Okay. And my detail equipment is still inside of the vehicle, so I'll have to take some of my detail equipment out of the- out of the trunk, well the hatch in the back.

Rashad Pride: Okay. Um- What I can do is, I'm going to um- get a- a tow truck, to go grab the vehicle.

J. Morris: Mhmm.

Rashad Pride: Okay, and I'm going to get it taken over to the BMW North facility.

J. Morris: Really?

Rashad Pride: Service, um, to their service shop and then that way they can obviously-

J. Morris: I- I really don't trust them, Sir. They're the people that that told me that the vehicle originally was 19,000. I have pictures of that. The paper. I even brought it with me. And then, magically the BMW is now 23,000. That- That- I found that really messed up that day. I didn't have a problem with it, because I planned on paying it off cash pretty quickly.

Rashad Pride: Yep.

J. Morris: But I'm- I'm- I don't think that I even want the car. What else is wrong with it? I don't know what else is wrong with it, and no one is tell- no one told me anything. No one said, hey, look, the reason why it's a- the only reason why I'm frustrated about that is because I drove that car seven hours to Oklahoma and seven hours back to get my son. I have ALS. That's an issue.

Rashad Pride: I'm- you said- you drove it to Oklahoma and drove it back, and that's an issue?

J. Morris: Yeah. I- I drove it to Oklahoma and back here in, uh, at the end of July, start of August, to- to get my sun- I drove it to Oklahoma and picked up my son and drove back. I have- I have- I've been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. I don't know if you know what ALS is. But, not having access to medical staff. You know, the only reason why it's an issue is, driving a car that's unreliable, that I assumed was a reliable car. I assumed it was a 2019 BMW with no issues because of the CarFax that I was given by Jose. So, I was under the impression that there was no-

Rashad Pride: CarFax wouldn't determine the vehicle's issues on a vehicle. Okay.

Rashad Pride: And there's- and there's even like from that standpoint of like um- and- it's not an excuse or anything like that is that um- we got the vehicle from the BMW location.

J. Morris: Mhmm.

Rashad Pride: And we sold the vehicle to you. And so now um- I'm trying to rectify that issue to get your vehicle and they can see, that they get it and and die at, see exactly what's wrong with the vehicle. But the problem with that is that they- they delivered you a vehicle that was sold to me that had the problem and was not repaired. That's, that's the issue. That's the issue.

Rashad Pride: And- and- and that's my thing. I don't know if the two things are related like I said, I don't have access to their system to see, like um- like you said, if- if the vehicle's able to drive from here to Oklahoma and back, then I- I don't think it at the time it had major issues because obviously it enhanced a lot of miles, and the car wouldn't had and stranded inside the road type of thing. So, that's why I- um- for us here, I don't have any BMW Master mechanics.

J. Morris: Okay.

Rashad Pride: But with them obviously, they have Master mechanics. And, um-

J. Morris: I would- I would rather it go to a different BMW dealership for for for work than to them. I don't trust them. They've already been twice two issues. A: The price problem. Secondly, the fact that it was brought to the other location with issue still wrong with it. I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm so not ok with trusting them with the safety of me and my family, who ride in that vehicle.

Rashad Pride: Yes, sir. So we do have another BMW location in the Woodlands.

J. Morris: Okay, I'll take it there.

Rashad Pride: I can get the vehicle to the location up in the Woodlands.

J. Morris: All right. I'm- I'm comfortable with that.

Rashad Pride: If that will be the best option for you. Okay, um to throw it that way. Yep.

Rashad Pride: So, I see that you um- do have the EasyCare warranty. So, with the EasyCare warranty has free towing.

J. Morris: So you're talking about me utilizing things that that that would constitute the the the um- the the finance company, stating that things have been utilized, thus not being able to reverse the-the-the- contract? I understand what- what- and that's you're just operating in your dealerships best interest, but it's not in my best interest.

Rashad Pride: No sir, I wasn't try- I- I just saw that it's a free towing service. So, that's why I was saying you can get it towed for free. I, I, I- that's how I was looking at it. I wasn't looking at it as a a trick or anything like that like- like you said. I'm just trying to help. Like I said, I know you've had some bad experiences, while having spoke to you or anything. I'm trying to fix the issue for you, sir. That's all I was trying to do. There was no trick behind it. Um- if you're not comfortable using the warranty then I'll pay for it out of my own pocket. That's fine with me. Here's- Here's the thing, I wouldn't want you to pay for something out of your pocket if it's not you- if it wasn't really your thing. If it wasn't for you to do wrong. And as is- as- as a founder of a corporation and as- as- as someone who manages and works and operates, I- I wouldn't want you to fall on your sword for that. That, that- that's not helpful to me or to you, or to your company. You know what I mean?

Rashad Pride: But- But- But you don't want to use the free one.

J. Morris: No, what I said is, I don't want to use the thing that's attached to- to financing. I don't want to- to put myself in a position where I- I'm obligated to do something else. But I will, but here's the thing, I'm willing to pay for towing. I'm willing to personally pay for towing.

Rashad Pride: Okay. And then, once it's towed- And then, I just want to- I just want to clear one thing up for you, Sir. So, the finance company and the warranty company are two separate things completely. So like the warranty is-is- is- is fully cancelable as the set- that's a separate transaction. The finance company doesn't sell the warranty or anything like that. So it's like it's two separate- it's two separate things. So um- that's why I was saying like if- if- if- I'm with you. So it's really useful. Ok. Then if it's that case, then yeah, I'm willing to do that. You know? Because I'm- I'm not looking to try and take something from you or from anybody that I- that's not already do me.

Rashad Pride: Thank you for that, Yes, sir. And- And that's what I say- I think that's the first step is getting the vehicle looked at, um, at a um- at the BMW facility, so we can exactly see what the issue is wrong with your vehicle. Um, and- and go from there, and obviously we can come together still and then make a decision after that.

J. Morris: All right, cool. I'm with that.

Rashad Pride: One second. Let me pull up your phone number really quick. Do you have a pin, Sir? If you email this information?

J. Morris: No, I would still would like for you to email it over to me, but uh- No, I don't have a pin, but I have my MacBook.

Rashad Pride: Ok, um, the number for the roadside assistance. Ok.

Rashad Pride: Is one- eight- six- six- three- six- zero- five- eight- three- one.

J. Morris: Yes Sir, I have 866-360-5831

Rashad Pride: Yes, Sir.

J. Morris: Yes, sir. Ok, what do I say?

Rashad Pride: You say um- you can give them the um- the last 6 of the Vin. You can give them-is-is-is this vehicle technically in your wife's name? Ok. Rashad Pride: Give them obviously your wife's information if they ask for it, or you can give them the last six of the Vin. And um- yes Sir. So it then that is: kilo- Lima- frank- three- one- five- zero- two.

J. Morris: Yes, sir.

Rashad Pride: And they have it- and they should be able to find under your wife's name as well, but that's the last six of the Vin they ask. And then, let me get you the address to the BMW and the Woodlands store. Do you want it too? Can I look it up real quick.

J. Morris: Yes, Sir. My office is in the Woodlands. So, I, I'll be able to- I think I know where they're at.

Rashad Pride: Okay. And the um- the good thing about it is, they- they might even have service loners over there as well. I don't know, um- I don't- I don't know um- what they have in store right now- at their stock, so I can even give you their phone number so you can set up- I get to see if they have a loner set up for you.

J. Morris: Okay.

Rashad Pride: That way you won't be out when you won't be without transportation. Then um- I can also send you over that- um, I'll send you over the AM Surf warranty. That's the 90-day or 4,000-mile warranty on the cars as far on our cars. So that you have that to give them as well. Ok. Rashad Pride: Then that way you won't have to worry about um-stuff beyond the pocket for you. Still will give the the the third party that- as far as like that BMW store um- they'll be able to pull up the previous service records, and then also see exactly what's wrong with your vehicle.

J. Morris: Yes, sir.

Rashad Pride: Ok. All right. Rashad Pride: And what I'll do like I said, um- I'm going to- the war- the information I gave for the roadside assistance, that's through the EasyCare warranty. And then, I'm going to email you over like I said, the am search warranty with that where you can get that at a- at the BMW. Ok, thank you.

Rashad Pride: And then, let me get you- you can- let me get you their phone number, Sir. That way um- you can reach out to them as well and let them know that you- you're getting your vehicle towed into them. They can give you kind of like um- some instructions as far as like um- what they have available, when- when's the best time for you and them, everything like that.

J. Morris: Yes, sir.

Rashad Pride: Um- the phone number is 936- seven seven seven- eight four- zero one. All right, cool. And this is AM Search warranty?

J. Morris: Got it.

Rashad Pride: All right. And like I said, uh- I'll email that over to you. It should be from part your contract paperwork, but in case like I said, I'll send uh- uh- I'll do have that email shortly.

J. Morris: Ok, I thank you so much.

Rashad Pride: And then uh- what I'm now sure have are been said we have you on already, but then, um- I'll check back in with you. Um, what's today's date? Um, Thursday. I'll call you tomorrow, or you can email me back exactly what they said when your car's going to be over there.

J. Morris: Ok.

Rashad Pride: And then I can do ma- whatever help that I need to do on my side to help you off with sending it out. Hello?

J. Morris: Hello, can you hear me?

J. Morris: Yes sir. I've got a stop communication. And then as far as the Mercedes you're saying you had issues with?

J. Morris: Yes, sir. Um every few days, we have to air that tire up. There's something wrong like, when we got the car, they had to air up the tire. Uh and it was like a- we were told, you know, you just have to drive it and they'll- they'll, you know, inflate the rest of the way on its own. And it should seal back up, but there's really something wrong with the tire. It keeps deflating. And the thing is it- it- we can't find a hole. So, it's either the tire or the rim and if the rim itself was bent then, you know, a bent rim leaks air. Uh We don't.

Rashad Pride: Sir, you said- you said you couldn't find the holes, do you kind of put water on already or-

J. Morris: No sir. No we didn't- We didn't put it on the water. We didn't take the tire off of the- off of the vehicle. We haven't taken the tire off. We've looked for it. I- I can- I can lift the car and rotate the wheel, because I do details.

Rashad Pride: Okay, um, well if you want, if you want to um- if that's the car you- that you're driving right now or-

J. Morris: No, I don't drive the Mercedes. My car is the BMW.

Rashad Pride: Got it. Okay. Um-

(Brief Pause)

Rashad Pride: Well, we can do- you can- you can stop by here we can have- I can have my guys, see what they do to retire for you. If you want to do that, or you can also-

J. Morris: We, we've taken it by Discount, but they didn't take the wheel off. That's what I'm saying. Discounts looked at it, they couldn't find it, but they didn't take the wheel off the car.

Rashad Pride: And what did they say?

J. Morris: Nothing. They had told me to go to ya'll. They said for us to take it back to ya'll.

Rashad Pride: Okay, yes sir. You- you can definitely stop by.

J. Morris: Ok.

Rashad Pride: And- and um- I can have one of my guys look at it exactly what's causing- then. How much air is leaking out is like are- like you said?

J. Morris: It- it goes from- no it'll- the- the tire goes- it doesn't go all the way low. I mean to- to empty. It'll go down to like 30- 32, or 34. But it's supposed to be stay at 37, or 38. And this is in the summer time where temperatures are above 90. You know? So, it's not because it's cooling at night, because the temperatures aren't- aren't dropping below 85. So, it's not that issue.

Rashad Pride: And- and it's only that you have the slow you trying right there. Ok. Yes, sir. Well you have some time like I said, you- you should definitely stop by and have them have them look at it for you. Ok, and then do it that way. All right.

Rashad Pride: That's works. Just keep in mind that our service department they close around four- 4:30.

J. Morris: Oh, then uh- Yeah, that's going to have to be on a weekend.

Rashad Pride: Okay, um, how about on Saturday?

J. Morris: Yes sir. available Saturday?

J. Morris: Yep, we're available Saturday.

Rashad Pride: Okay, um, if you want to stop by Saturday?

J. Morris: Okay.

Rashad Pride: Um- Saturday and uh- If you want to stop by Saturday morning? Saturday afternoon? I can have them check it out for you because on Saturday we actually closer but earlier is back.

J. Morris: I can be there Saturday morning. I'm up early Saturdays.

Rashad Pride: Okay, um if you want to stop by Saturday morning about like 9:30 or 10? Yes sir. Rashad Pride: That'd be perfect. All right, sounds good. All right, just let me check it out for you. I have them pull it off and and try to find that reason through what's going on with it as well for you.

J. Morris: Sounds good, I'll be there. Ok, Sounds good, sir. Like I said, I'm going to forward you over the information for the BMW warranty and everything like that. And now that you have my information and then we'll just-I'll just talk to you tomorrow.

J. Morris: Yes sir. Alright sir, I'll talk to you soon.

J. Morris: Talk to you tomorrow.

Rashad Pride: Bye-bye.

(End of call)
