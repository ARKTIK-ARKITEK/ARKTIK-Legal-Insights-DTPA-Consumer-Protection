## **Conversation Script & Transcript**

### **(Beginning of Call)**

**J. Morris:** I'm sorry, your name again?  
**Rashad Pride:** Rashad Pride.  

**J. Morris:** Okay. Hi, Mr. Rashad.  
**Rashad Pride:** Hey, sir. I received the email from you yesterday. I was concerned about two cars that were purchased through us?  
**J. Morris:** Yes, sir.  

**Rashad Pride:** So, I want to reach out to you and talk to you about it. So, what's going on, sir? How can I help?  

**J. Morris:** Okay. Um, there are two vehicles. There's the BMW and there's the Mercedes.  
**Rashad Pride:** Yes, sir.  

**J. Morris:** I purchased both vehicles. I went to BMW North, looked at the BMW. My wife and I sat down inside the showroom and asked about seeing vehicles for $20,000 or less. We were shown a BMW X3 listed at **$19,000**. The sales associate left, then returned saying the price was now **$23,000**. I refused and left.  

**J. Morris:** Later that day, **Jose from AutoNation called me** and said he could secure the BMW for under **$22,000** along with a **2019 Mercedes-Benz GLC 300**. He stated both cars would be **$20,000 each**. Based on that, I agreed to the purchase. However, after the sale, I discovered **serious defects in the BMW that were never disclosed.**  

**Rashad Pride:** So, both cars have issues, or just the BMW?  
**J. Morris:** There have been problems with both, but the **major issues are with the BMW**.  

### **Mechanical Issues & Fraudulent Sales Practices**

**J. Morris:** Less than a week after purchase, I noticed **dashboard malfunctions**. The digital cluster wouldn’t display correctly or wouldn’t turn on at all. Later, a **low coolant warning appeared**, and the system advised not to drive. I had to **refill coolant multiple times within a month.**

I contacted **Jose, Mohammad, and later Valerie Bittle (AutoNation Sales Manager).** Valerie admitted on a recorded call that **the required pre-sale repair order was never completed**, meaning the **BMW was sold with known mechanical issues**.

**Rashad Pride:** You're talking about the BMW, not the Mercedes?  
**J. Morris:** Correct.  

**Rashad Pride:** And the BMW is in your wife’s name?  
**J. Morris:** Yes, her name is Tenille Morris.  

### **Response from AutoNation**

**J. Morris:** I reached out again regarding the **coolant issue**. I was told by Valerie that AutoNation **wasn’t responsible for repairs** and that I should contact BMW North, where the original inspection was done. However, BMW North **denied responsibility**, stating that AutoNation USA Houston completed the sale, so the **burden was on them**.

When I emailed for further resolution, **AutoNation stopped responding.** I attempted to negotiate a **repair agreement** where I would keep both cars if repairs were covered. However, lack of communication and **stonewalling** forced me to escalate the matter legally.

### **Resolution Attempts & Loan Reversal**

**J. Morris:** ACA (American Credit Acceptance) initially acknowledged **that a loan reversal was possible** due to the dealership's fraudulent sales tactics. However, despite this, **ACA repossessed both vehicles and sold them at auction on January 9, 2025**, compounding my financial losses.  

**Rashad Pride:** I apologize that you’re experiencing this. That was never our intent. I don’t know why Valerie said the repair order wasn’t completed because our company **doesn’t sell vehicles without proper inspections**. I will look into this.  

**J. Morris:** The BMW is currently **undrivable** due to **persistent coolant leaks**. Valerie already confirmed on a recorded call that the **vehicle was sold without necessary repairs.**

**Rashad Pride:** Let’s arrange to tow the vehicle to BMW of The Woodlands for a full inspection. Your car is under **EasyCare extended warranty**, so we might be able to cover the repairs.

**J. Morris:** I don’t trust BMW North due to the **initial price misrepresentation and lack of repairs**. I would prefer a different dealership.

**Rashad Pride:** We have a **BMW location in The Woodlands** that we can send it to instead. I will set up a tow truck.

### **Concerns About Loan & Warranty Coverage**

**J. Morris:** I need to ensure that **using the warranty won’t prevent ACA from reversing the loan.** If I request warranty-covered repairs, ACA may argue that **I’ve accepted the vehicle’s condition, making a refund impossible.**

**Rashad Pride:** I understand your concerns. The **warranty and finance contract are separate.** Using the warranty for repairs **should not** impact the possibility of loan reversal.  

### **Next Steps**

1. **AutoNation will arrange a tow truck** to transport the BMW to **BMW of The Woodlands**.
2. **J. Morris will receive an update via email** on repair authorization.
3. **A resolution meeting will be scheduled** to discuss whether AutoNation can **fully repair the vehicle or offer a buyback.**
4. **Further legal steps will be taken** if AutoNation does not uphold fair consumer practices.

**End of Call**

---

**Summary:** This conversation confirms AutoNation’s **inconsistent pricing practices**, **failure to disclose defects**, and **attempts to deflect responsibility**. Mr. Pride acknowledges that a **repair order should have been completed** and offers a solution, but warranty and financial implications remain a concern.

**Next Actions:** Await repair evaluation, continue pursuing **loan reversal**, and escalate legal action if needed.
