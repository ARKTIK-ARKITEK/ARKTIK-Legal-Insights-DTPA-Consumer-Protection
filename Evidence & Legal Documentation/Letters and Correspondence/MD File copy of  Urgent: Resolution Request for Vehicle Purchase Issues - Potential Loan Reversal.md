Urgent: Resolution Request for Vehicle Purchase Issues - Potential Loan Reversal  

# J Michael Morris <j.morris@arktikinitiative.org> To: "Pride, Rashad" <PrideR@autonation.com>

Dear Mr. Pride,  
Fri, Sep 6, 2024 at 8:35 AM  
Thank you for reaching out and for our conversation regarding the issues with both the 2019 BMW X3 and the 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLC 300. I appreciate your offer to have the BMW X3 towed to BMW of the Woodlands for inspection at your expense and to cover any towing costs personally.  
However, I would like to clarify a few key points:  
1. **Loan Reversal Concerns:** As discussed, my primary concern is ensuring that my use of any warranty services- whether for towing or repairs-does not compromise my ability to pursue a loan reversal. I am particularly concerned about this given the misrepresentation and undisclosed issues with both vehicles, including those involving the BMW's coolant system and the GLC 300's rear wheel and braking behavior.

2. **Previous Dealership Issues:** I also expressed that I do not trust BMW North of Houston to inspect or repair the BMW X3 due to the issues created by their incomplete inspection and the subsequent problems I've experienced with the vehicle. This situation has caused significant inconvenience, and I am still without reliable transportation for my work, which includes ARKTIK Mobile Detailing and Uber deliveries.

3. **GLC 300 Concerns:** Additionally, I have noticed further issues with the Mercedes-Benz GLC 300, particularly a slow leak in the rear wheel and what seems to be an abnormal braking or deceleration issue when taking my foot off the throttle. These issues were not disclosed at the time of sale, further impacting my confidence in the vehicle's reliability.

4. **Loaner Car:** Since the BMW X3 is critical for my transportation and business operations, I also asked about a loaner vehicle from BMW of the Woodlands during the repair period, but I have yet to receive confirmation on this.

**Next Steps:** While I appreciate your willingness to address the issues, I still prefer not to proceed with any warranty services until I have full assurance that it will not affect my right to a loan reversal, should that be necessary. Please confirm in writing that the use of any warranty services will not impact the loan reversal process.

I look forward to your prompt response and hope we can find a resolution that ensures fairness and transparency for both parties.  
Best regards,

J. Michael F. Morris
