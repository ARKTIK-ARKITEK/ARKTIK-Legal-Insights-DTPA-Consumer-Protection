## Key Allegations Against ACA

### 1. Misleading Financial Guidance
- ACA advised the complainant on multiple recorded calls to withhold payments pending dispute resolution with AutoNation USA Houston.
- The complainant relied on this guidance in good faith, expecting ACA to work toward a resolution.
- ACA later used the withheld payments as justification to repossess both vehicles, despite their own prior instructions.

### 2. Wrongful Repossession
- **Both vehicles were repossessed on November 13, 2024**, despite:
  - The **BMW X3 being inoperable** since September 4, 2024.
  - The **temporary tags still being expired** at the time of repossession.
  - The complainant actively working to resolve the disputes.
- ACA’s repossession directly resulted from their own misleading financial advice, causing financial hardship and loss of reliable transportation.

### 3. Dismissal of CFPB Case Based on Technicality
- ACA responded to **CFPB Complaint ID 241116-16992576** by stating that the complainant **was not listed on the BMW’s financing contract** and therefore, ACA had **no obligation** to address the issue.
- **Legal Argument Against ACA’s Position**:
  - Texas is a **community property state**, meaning that **all purchases during marriage are shared assets**.
  - ACA’s argument ignores Texas law and violates fair lending practices by disregarding the financial obligations and shared ownership between spouses.

### 4. Financial and Personal Damages
- **Loss of Income**:
  - The **BMW X3 was used for Uber**, generating **$120/day** to support the household and nonprofit operations.
- **Loss of Transportation**:
  - The repossession left the **family without reliable transportation**.
  - The **complainant’s 12-year-old child’s school is not on a Metro bus route**, making attendance difficult.
- **Credit Damage**:
  - The wrongful repossession **negatively impacted the complainant’s credit score**, affecting future financial opportunities.
